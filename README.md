# LicenseManager

This plugin offers a more player orientated approach to extend abilities to users without traditional permission nodes.
 
Only a few admin-level nodes are required to create, list and revoke licenses.

These licenses are simply signed books written by admins that contain [tags] which contain information used by other plugins.
